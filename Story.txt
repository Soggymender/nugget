In 1983 the United States launched an interstellar probe named Epoch II.
After successfully entering interstellar space and reaching end-of-life,
its power sources depleted, it powered down and ground support disbanded.

Three days ago Space Command received an unexpected signal from the probe.

Sorry we had to call you in at such an odd hour. There's been an... unusual development.

Have you ever heard of Epoch II? It's a space probe launched by the US 


Probe has "subroutine" slots. Each program written can be assigned to a subroutine slot
and takes up memory. Subroutine size totals must fit in total memory. Initially only a few
subroutine slots are available/functioning. Puzzes can be solved later to open them up.
Subroutine slots can be called from other subroutines, or from the main routine.
